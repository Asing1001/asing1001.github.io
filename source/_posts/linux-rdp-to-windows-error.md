Today When I connect to Windows through `Remote Desktop Viewer` got `error connecting to host` prompt.
After searching the solution is to remove the server I'm having issue in `$home/.freerdp/known_hosts` and reconnecting again.

```bash
[sing@study ~]$ vi ~/.freerdp/known_hosts
# In Vim, remove the line start with server ip you are connecting to by `dd`, and `:wq` to save the file.
```
