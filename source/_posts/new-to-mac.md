Today I start to use MAC for developing on my new job, it is really painful that so many shortcut or convention are different.
So I decided to log it down for me and any new comer for MAC :) 

## Must install

* homebrew
* Alfred

## Shortcut

* Print screen area: command + control + shift + 4 (control is optional for copy to clickboard)
* Open link in new tab: command + click
