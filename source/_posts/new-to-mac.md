Today I start to use MAC for developing on my new job, it is really painful that so many shortcut or convention are different.
So I decided to log it down for me and any new comer for MAC :) 

## Must install

* homebrew
* iterm2

## Shortcut

* Print screen area: command + control + shift + 4 (control is optional for copy to clickboard)
* Open link in new tab: command + click
* Delete file: command + backspace
* Lock screen: ctrl + command + q

## Settings

* Finder
    `View` > `Show Status Bar`, `Show Path Bar`

## Optional install

* [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
* [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
    change default shell to zsh with `chsh -s $(which zsh`
